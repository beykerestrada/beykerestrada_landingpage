          "quote": "I engaged Beyker to help structure and automate several operational workflows. What stood out immediately was his ability to listen, understand the underlying pain points, and translate needs into working solutions. Beyker didn't just configure tools - he mapped out systems and processes so I could hit the ground running from day one. He's exceptionally resourceful, whether building direct integrations or finding creative workarounds when standard connections don't exist. His knowledge spans the full productivity stack: Notion, Make, N8N, and most current platforms. Beyond technical expertise, Beyker is a true partner. He takes feedback seriously, iterates quickly, and isn't satisfied until everything actually works the way you need it to. He'll invest the extra time to get processes right rather than deliver something functional but incomplete. If you're looking for someone who can integrate systems, automate workflows, and build scalable infrastructure across platforms, Beyker is the resource you need. I highly recommended him.",

      "a": "A 60-minute deep-dive call where we map your current systems and pain points, a complete workspace audit, and a detailed report showing what's broken, what to fix first, and exactly how much it would cost to build. 50% of audit clients move to implementation."
    },
    "question2": {
      "q": "How long does implementation take?",
      "a": "Systems Audit: 1 week. Business Operating System: 6-8 weeks. Ultimate Business OS: 8-10 weeks. All timelines include team training and documentation. You'll see progress in weekly increments, not at the end."

    "question3": {
      "q": "Will my team actually use this, or will it collect dust?",
      "a": "Every system is built around your team's actual workflows, not generic templates. Training is included. Documentation is clear. Most teams are fully onboarded within 2 weeks because the system is designed for them, not against them."
    },
    "question4": {
      "q": "What if we need changes after the project is done?",
      "a": "All projects include 2-4 weeks of post-launch support for adjustments. After that, you can handle most changes yourself (everything is documented), or you can book ad-hoc hours or establish a retainer for ongoing work."

    },
    "question2": {
      "q": "Do you work with n8n, Zapier, or Make?",

    "question3": {
      "q": "How long does implementation take?",
