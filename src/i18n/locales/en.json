It was overwhelming. Beyker designed a Notion workspace that simplified everything without losing functionality. The clean interface, the data visualizations, and the way information is organized have added tremendous value to how I run my coaching practice. Now I can easily see my workload, track my conversion funnel, and understand my business metrics at a glance. This system has genuinely changed the way I work.
