      "a": "A 60-minute deep-dive call where we map your current systems and pain points, a complete workspace audit, and a detailed report showing what's broken, what to fix first, and exactly how much it would cost to build. 50% of audit clients move to implementation."

    "question2": {
      "q": "How long does implementation take?",
      "a": "Systems Audit: 1 week. Business Operating System: 6-8 weeks. Ultimate Business OS: 8-10 weeks. All timelines include team training and documentation. You'll see progress in weekly increments, not at the end."

      "q": "Will my team actually use this, or will it collect dust?",
      "a": "Every system is built around your team's actual workflows, not generic templates. Training is included. Documentation is clear. Most teams are fully onboarded within 2 weeks because the system is designed for them, not against them."

    "question4": {
      "q": "What if we need changes after the project is done?",
      "a": "All projects include 2-4 weeks of post-launch support for adjustments. After that, you can handle most changes yourself (everything is documented), or you can book ad-hoc hours or establish a retainer for ongoing work."
